                <p>This past February I typed my first JavaScript function and since then, I have discovered a new passion in my life. My name is Michael Danko and I am a front end engineer living in Indian Land, South Carolina. I had the fortune to be apart of The Iron Yard - Charlotte's first group of students to enroll and complete the JavaScript and MVC Frameworks course. Prior to the 12 week immersive course, I could barely explain the difference between classes and IDs used in HTML5 but now I am proficient enough to be exploring frameworks such as AngularJS.</p>
                
                <p>As a developer, I am self motivated to do what it takes to complete any project I am working on. I enjoy collaborating on bigger projects with others since I believe in seeking out additional perspectives. At this stage in my programming career, I understand that there might be more efficient ways to write my code therefore I try to emulate the more experienced developers around me. I enjoy attending local Meetups in the Charlotte area that are focused on web development. The community of developers is just one thing I enjoy the most about creating web applications. The helpfulness is what pushes me to give back and contribute to the open-source community.</p>
