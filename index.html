                <p>This past February I typed my first JavaScript function and since then, I have discovered a new passion in my life. My name is Michael Danko and I am a front end engineer living in Indian Land, South Carolina. I had the fortune to be apart of The Iron Yard - Charlotte's first group of students to enroll and complete the JavaScript and MVC Frameworks course. Prior to the 12 week immersive course, I could barely explain the difference between classes and IDs used in HTML5 but now I am proficient enough to be exploring frameworks such as AngularJS.</p>
                
                <p>As a developer, I am self motivated to do what it takes to complete any project I am working on. I enjoy collaborating on bigger projects with others since I believe in seeking out additional perspectives. At this stage in my programming career, I understand that there might be more efficient ways to write my code therefore I try to emulate the more experienced developers around me. I enjoy attending local Meetups in the Charlotte area that are focused on web development. The community of developers is just one thing I enjoy the most about creating web applications. The helpfulness is what pushes me to give back and contribute to the open-source community.</p>
               
                <p>My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words. My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website.</p>
